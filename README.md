# README for Advent of Code Solutions Repository (Python)

## Overview

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This repository contains my personal solutions to the challenges presented in the Advent of Code, an annual series of fun and engaging programming puzzles. The solutions are written in Python and are organized by year and day.

## Structure

Each year of the Advent of Code is represented by a separate directory, named with the year (e.g., `2023`). Inside each year's directory, there are archives for each day, labeled as `day_1`, `day_2`, etc., containing the solution for that specific day.

```
